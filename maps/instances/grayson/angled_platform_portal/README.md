# Func_Instance: Aperture Science Piston-mounted Angled Panel

This test involves the Aperture Science Piston-mounted Angled Panel. It is part of the initiative to investigate how well test subjects solve problems when catapulted into space. Results were highly informative. They could not.

The panel can be rotated and the portal can be activated if the test subject is using a portal gun that only shoots blue portals.

## Note:

Get logic_auto to fire instance:clear_orange_portals;Trigger when spawning a test subject in a map (OnMapSpawn). Without it, orange portal won't spawn.
